# Turtle Graphics

This project implements a Turtle Graphics simulation using the Qt framework. Turtle Graphics allows users to create visual patterns and designs by controlling a "turtle" that moves around the screen, leaving a trail as it goes. This application lets users command the turtle to move, turn, change color of the trail and play a little game.

## Features
- **Interactive Controls**: Move the turtle with basic commands like forward and turn.
- **GUI Integration**: Built with Qt's `QGraphicsView` or `QGraphicsScene` for smooth, responsive graphics.
- More coming soon in 2025

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Qt (5.x or later).
3. Build and run the project using Qt Creator or the command line.

## Example Commands
- **Forward**: Move the turtle forward by a specified number of steps.
- **Turn**: Rotate the turtle a specified angle.
- **Pen Up**: Stop drawing the trail
- **Pen Down**: Continue drawing the trail
- **Color(R,G,B)** Change color of the trail
- **...**
