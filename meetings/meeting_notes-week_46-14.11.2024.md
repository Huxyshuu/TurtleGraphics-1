## Week 45 - Meeting 14.11.2024 14:00

**Participants**: 
1. Hugo Tamm
2. Xiwei Zhao
3. Giang Le
4. Mathias CastrÃ©n 

## Summary of works

1. Basic of the project/program have been completed
2. Turtle can turn and move on user input
3. Turtle displays trajectory
4. Terminal shows history of commands
5. Turtle could jump to one required coordinates and move forward smoothly

## Challenges

- How to design our language processor using GPT?

  - user: I would like to draw a heart

    -> Out: replay("heart_trajectory_history") (if *heart* feature has been recorded before, we could replay the trajectory)

    -> Out: we do not have this feature in history, could you create your own heart right now using some simple command? :) (if we do not have the *heart* history, could offer the help information for the user) 

  - user: I want to move it forward 100

    -> Out: forward 100

  - user: I want to put it at 100,100

    -> Out: go 100 100

  - user: pick up the pen and move the turtle at 100,100

    -> drawing_ = False; go 100 100

  - user: put down the turtle, turn 90 degrees and make it move forward 100

    -> drawing_ = True; turn 90; forward 100
