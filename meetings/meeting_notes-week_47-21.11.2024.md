## Week 47 - Meeting 21.11.2024 15:00

**Participants**: 
1. Hugo Tamm
2. Xiwei Zhao
3. Giang Le
4. Mathias CastrÃ©n 

## Summary of works

1. Basic of the project/program have been completed
2. Turtle can turn and move on user input
3. Turtle displays trajectory
4. Terminal shows history of commands
5. upload a command txt file and run directly
6. Turtle could jump to one required coordinates and move forward smoothly

## Challenges

- struggling with the sound
- Animation crashing the program when typing another command while first one is still running
- Colour changing issues

## Actions

1. Xiwei
   - training the language processor
   - change line color and width
2. Mathias
   - Do unit tests of each class before you integrate it into the project to validate its operation.
   - Make a block in the map where the turle has to go (Gameify the turtle)
3. Giang
   - work on "save file" function
   - design more shapes saved as a txt file: heart, star, circle, rectangular, triangle, house.
4. Hugo
   - Make a queue for commands
   - Get valgrind running 

> Please reflect these action decisions in your git commit messages so that 
> your group members and advisor can follow the progress.

## Project status 

Perfecting the **advanced** features and implementing additional features.

## TODOs:

- design our language processor using GPT: Xiwei

  - user: I would like to draw a heart

    -> Out: replay("heart_trajectory_history") (if *heart* feature has been recorded before, we could replay the trajectory)

    -> Out: we do not have this feature in history, could you create your own heart right now using some simple command? :) (if we do not have the *heart* history, could offer the help information for the user) 

  - user: I want to move it forward 100

    -> Out: forward 100

  - user: I want to put it at 100,100

    -> Out: go 100 100

  - user: pick up the pen and move the turtle at 100,100

    -> drawing_ = False; go 100 100

  - user: put down the turtle, turn 90 degrees and make it move forward 100

    -> drawing_ = True; turn 90; forward 100

- work on "save file" function: Giang
  
  - the file should be saved as a txt file with command history
- design more shapes saved as a txt file: heart, star, circle, rectangular, triangle, house. Giang
- change line color and width: Xiwei
- Do unit tests of each class
- Gameify the turtle
- Make a queue for commands
- run valgrind on the project
